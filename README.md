# Vehicle-cut in detection
This is my first repository on GitHub.
The proper dataset has been taken from the IDD website from the given link: "http://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/".
The problem statement "vehicle cut-in detection" asks to detect or give warning at least 0.6 seconds before another vehicle cuts in, to prevent accidents prevelant in any part of the country.
For the implementation of the file, datasets have been downloaded and uploaded on drive and then the code has been run on Google Colab using CNN.
A new model has been trained using tensorflow and YOLO.
The datasets are differnt for training, validation and testing purposes.
The training,validation and testing dataset comprises of 23493,25410 and 20171 images respectively.
